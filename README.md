# 🌰 Arecanut Detection System

A real-time object detection system for identifying arecanuts using YOLOv8. This project leverages computer vision to aid in the automated detection of arecanuts from live camera feeds or webcams.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify arecanuts in real-time. The system was trained and evaluated using labeled images annotated via Roboflow.

## 🧠 Model Details

* **Model Variants Tested:** YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m
* **Best Performing Model:** YOLOv8m
* **Epochs:** 200–250
* **Accuracy:** 93%
* **Precision:** 94%
* **Annotation Tool:** Roboflow

## 📸 Dataset

* Annotated using **Roboflow**
* Includes various lighting conditions, angles, and arecanut states
* Exported in YOLO format

## ✨ Future Work

* Deploy on edge devices (e.g., Jetson Nano)
* Integrate crop health analysis
* Build a mobile-friendly version

## 🛠️ Built By

* Lakshan Krithik
* Siddarth A
* Ajendra Charuvila
